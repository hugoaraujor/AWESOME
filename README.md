# STARTREK

You will find the executable file in 
\awesome-project\awesome-project\awesome-project\bin\Debug
called awesome-project.exe
You can run that from command prompt as you tell
using
awesome-project Uhura or 
awesome-project Amidala
awesome-project Luke Skywalker
awesome-project Dark Vader
as you want

In the tranlation proccess there is no instruction pertaining to conversion of equals letters with different case
like q and Q so we will take the hex code related as example.

In species we are showing just the first name species name

Hope it fix your needs and enjoy!
